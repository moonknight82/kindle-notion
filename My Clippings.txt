///Beagle, puppy, infant, male . . . She bends closer, her ears now tuned to hear the plaintiveness in his wail, the need, the fright. It stimulates an ache inside her. She reaches and gently scoops up the pup and brings him closer. His body shivers, both cold and scared. She draws him into her warmth. He responds and quiets, his cries softer now, just murmurs against her breast. Through his so-thin ribs, she feels a heartbeat thrumming, so much faster than hers. She drapes a palm along his back, rubbing a thumb by a soft ear. His eyes close, his breathing slows. A warm, soft tongue licks; a small mouth suckles a finger. In that moment, she both senses and learns so much more. Each heartbeat marks the passage of time. The tender body teaches her ///fragility, need, gentleness.

(Adam, nose to the ground, tail high in the air, doggedly pursuing a scent.) She patterns his behavior—driven forward by a chorus of need, so many heartbeats to preserve. A hundred thousand Adams. Fear and curiosity no longer motivate her. Instead . . . (Adam sits in a sunlit glade, tongue lolling, tail swishing grass, his eyes upon her with hope and love.) She could not save her little boy, but she could do something to make his memory burn brighter in her circuits. She would take his example, all he has taught her, use that going forward. And in this way . . . I will honor him.

Ron Mallet, a theoretical physicist from the University of Connecticut, has postulated that ring lasers could have the same effect on spacetime and gravity as a black hole, allowing for binary code messages to be transmitted into the past. Other physicists have shown that the property of quantum entanglement could be used to move messages into the past (or future)—and it gets even weirder with quantum teleportation (yes, that’s real, too). Here are two bread crumbs to follow: “Weird! Quantum Entanglement Can Reach into the Past,” by Clara Moskowitz, Live Science, April 30, 2012 “Is Communication from the Future Already Here?” Robert Torres, Epoch Times, January 11, 2016

“But where does the truth come into all this?” “It doesn’t. Social media has absolutely nothing to do with the truth. It has to do with making shitloads of money off ads trying to sell people crap they don’t need. But the terrible by-product of that is giving a global platform to the absolute worst elements of society. The result is that ‘truth’ is whatever you can convince people it is. It’s exactly what Orwell wrote about.”

A supercomputer, running for four years, had to solve two hundred billion equations in order to draw an image of it—an admittedly very imperfect image.

The musicians are adapting to each other but also insisting on their own prerogatives.

By the way, this tells you why Auto-Tuned vocals on many contemporary records sound so shallow and lifeless. It’s almost as if everything we learned from African American music during the twentieth century was thrown out the window by technologists in the twenty-first century. The goal should not be to sing every note dead center in the middle of the pitch—we escaped from that musical prison a hundred years ago. Why go back?

For example, check out the Ahmad Jamal trio tracks from the 1950s, and marvel at a group that could swing with fervor at very fast tempos, yet with such control over the volume that you can hear every nuance. (Start with the YouTube video of Jamal performing “Darn That Dream,” filmed at CBS Studios in New York in December 1957, which still leaves me gobsmacked every time I watch it.)

If you learn anything from this guide to listening, let it be a respect for the demands of the music—a realization that understanding jazz (or any other form of artistic expression) can never be reduced to personal whim or some flamboyant deconstructive manipulation of signifiers but always builds on a humble realization that these works impose their reality on us. The work of art always requires us to adapt to it—and in this manner can be distinguished from escapism or shallow entertainment, which instead aims to adapt to the audience, to give the public exactly what it wants. We can tell that we are encountering a real work of art by the degree to which it resists our subjectivity.

And if you still aren’t sure whether a musician is really improvising, just ask the other members of the band. I assure you that they know. But after you have developed your listening skills in jazz, you probably won’t need to make such inquiries. You will feel it in the music and cherish it as the most magical part of the jazz idiom.

Se, em vez de entrar para um plano de previdência complementar, você investir a mesma quantia em ações, terá um rendimento crescente, que não acabará nunca. Mas se seguir o conselho do jornalista que escreveu aquela matéria, e aplicar em poupança, terá rendimentos mensais de 1.175 dólares após quinze anos, se durante esse tempo aplicar todo mês 200 dólares. Se quiser transformar sua aplicação num saldo perpétuo, você só poderá sacar miseráveis 292 dólares por mês, quantia que em qualquer parte do mundo o colocará abaixo do nível de subsistência. Basta comparar esses míseros 292 dólares com os opulentos 5 mil dólares mensais que você receberia em dividendos, para concluir o quanto são irresponsáveis os conselheiros que não entendem do assunto sobre o qual dão conselhos.

Os índices de correção das pensões são fixados pelo governo, que, desonestamente, manda pagar menos que a taxa de corrosão da moeda. Essa política cruel, mas sistemática, faz com que as pensões decresçam de maneira gradual, quase imperceptível, o que só é constatado depois de alguns anos, quando a vítima não tem mais possibilidade de reagir.

Por volta de 1970, um administrador do Fundo “157” dizia em alto e bom som para quem quisesse ouvir: – Todo dia eu mando comprar. Se a cotação sobe, eu me apodero dos papéis; se desce, jogo-os no “157”. Mensalmente eu faço uma verificação do portfólio. As ações que se valorizaram são minhas; as que se desvalorizaram ficam no Fundo. Só não detalhava sua maneira de agir.

Um exemplo de má divulgação do mercado acionário ocorreu durante a contagem dos votos do primeiro turno das eleições para presidente da República. Os jornais disseram que a Bolsa subiu às 10 horas porque Collor se firmou na liderança; que caiu às 11 porque Lula passou Brizola; e que terminou em queda porque se estreitou a diferença entre Collor e o segundo colocado... Despautérios desse gênero transmitem ao leigo a impressão fantasista de que os Investidores da Bolsa constituem-se de pessoas de raciocínio rápido, com o dedo no gatilho, prontas para tomar decisões instantâneas; de que só ganha na Bolsa quem anda com o ouvido colado ao rádio; e de que o menor erro ou descuido será fatal. De acordo com essa visão, negociar com ações seria tão perigoso quanto andar numa corda bamba, sobre o Anhangabaú, entre os edifícios do Banespa e da antiga Light. Nada mais falso. O Investidor consciente dispensa palpites de operadores que raciocinam rápido. E demora semanas para tomar uma decisão, como o atirador que “dorme” na pontaria. Quando atira, não erra.

I sat there wondering what it would be like dealing with that kind of thing, full-time. Growing up with a head full of beauty and the gift of interpretation, being told how brilliant you were by the people who loved you – getting hooked on the oohs and ahs – only to enter what passed for ‘the real world’ and learn that love didn’t mean a damn thing.

Celebrity by association. For most people, fandom’s a fling that ends when they grow up. But certain borderline personalities never mature, and what starts out as a harmless ego-substitution – the kid standing in front of a mirror playing air guitar and imagining himself to be Hendrix – can turn into a psychological hijacking.’

“One of Heron’s inventions was the means to magically open the doors to a temple using a crude version of a steam engine. A priest would speak to a crowd on the steps of a closed temple, then a fire would be lit in a hearth in front of the place. Once it got blazing hot, the fire would heat a water system buried underneath the hearth. The resulting steam would move pistons, wheels, and ropes, and the temple doors would seem to magically open on their own.”

This novel touches upon similar concoctions found in the myths and stories surrounding the sorceress Medea, who helped Jason of the Argonauts defeat all manner of fiery mechanical automatons, from Talos of Crete to the Colchis Bulls. It is said she did develop two important potions: Medea’s Oil (which possessed the secret to an unquenchable fire, a gift from Prometheus, and very much like Greek Fire) and Promethean (what I called “Promethean Blood” in the novel, which

As to the Holy Scrinium, the original traveling library of the popes, it truly did exist and was said to hold rare treasures going back to the founding of Christendom. Does it still exist?

Entre as coisas que existem, há aquelas subordinadas a nós e as não subordinadas a nós. As subordinadas a nós são o pensamento,1 o impulso,2 o desejo,3 o evitar 4 e, em síntese, todas as operações que executamos;5 as não subordinadas a nós são o corpo,6 os bens,7 a reputação,8 os cargos9 e, em síntese, tudo aquilo que não são operações que executamos.

Quando te dispões a realizar alguma ação, recorda-te de qual é a natureza dessa ação. Se estás saindo para tomar um banho, antecipa mentalmente o que acontece numa sala de banhos,20 ou seja, indivíduos que jogam água em ti, indivíduos que esbarram em ti, indivíduos que te insultam, indivíduos que te roubam. E assim tu irás executar tua ação com maior segurança se disseres de imediato: “Quero tomar banho e também conservar minha vontade em harmonia com a natureza”.

Não são as coisas que perturbam as pessoas, mas os pareceres a respeito das coisas;21 por exemplo, a morte nada tem de amedrontadora (pois assim também não pareceu a Sócrates),22 mas o parecer sobre a morte é que é amedrontador. A conclusão é que quando experimentamos aborrecimento ou perturbação ou aflição, não é o caso de responsabilizar os outros por isso, mas a nós mesmos, ou seja, aos nossos próprios pareceres. É ação de um ignorante acusar os outros dos próprios males; atribuir a culpa a si mesmo é atitude de alguém que dá início a sua educação; aquele que nem acusa aos outros nem a si mesmo já é alguém educado.

Não te orgulhes de uma qualidade superior que não é tua. Seria admissível se o cavalo se orgulhasse dizendo “Eu sou belo”;23 quando tu, porém, se orgulha dizendo: “Possuo um belo cavalo”24, podes crer que estás te orgulhando de um bem do cavalo25. Então o que é de ti? O emprego das ideias. Resulta que, quando empregas ideias em consonância com a natureza, podes nesse caso orgulhar-te, pois então te orgulhas de algum bem que é teu.

Diante de cada um dos acontecimentos que atingem31 a ti, lembra de te voltares para ti mesmo em busca daquele poder que tens para tirar proveito de tal acontecimento. Se vês um belo jovem32 ou uma bela mulher33, encontrarás o poder para enfrentá-los no autocontrole34; se diante de um trabalho árduo, encontra-lo-ás na paciência35; diante do insulto, encontra-lo-ás na resignação36. E se te acostumares assim, as ideias não te dominarão.

Se queres progredir, resigna-te a parecer externamente um insensato e um estúpido, e nem queiras ostentar que possuis qualquer conhecimento; e se gozares de alguma boa reputação, desconfia de ti mesmo. Com efeito, saiba que não é fácil conservares tua vontade em conformidade com a natureza e manter externamente as aparências: pelo contrário, é inteiramente inevitável que aquele que se ocupa de uma dessas coisas venha a negligenciar a outra.

Se queres que teus filhos, tua esposa e teus amigos vivam para sempre, és um tolo, pois estás querendo que aquilo que não está subordinado a ti esteja subordinado a ti e que aquilo que não pertence a ti pertença a ti; assim, se queres que teu pequeno escravo não cometa erros, és um insensato, pois neste caso estás querendo que o vício não seja vício, mas uma outra coisa. Se, todavia, o que queres é não deixar de alcançar o que desejas, disso és capaz. Portanto, ocupa-te daquilo de que és capaz. Cada senhor de alguém é aquele que possui o poder sobre o que esse alguém quer ou não quer no sentido de conservá-lo ou suprimi-lo. Consequentemente, aquele que quer ser livre nem deseje nem se esquive das coisas que estão subordinadas a outros, caso contrário será forçosamente um escravo.

Lembra que te deves comportar como se estivesses num banquete37. Se o prato que circula chegou a ti, estende a mão e toma uma porção de modo decente e polido. Passou ao teu lado? Não o detém. Se não chegou a ti ainda, não projetes de longe o teu desejo por ele, mas aguarda até que chegue a ti.

Lembra que não é aquele que te insulta ou aquele que te agride os agentes da violência, mas sim a tua opinião de que eles são violentos contigo. Por conseguinte, quando alguém te provoca, saiba que foi tua própria opinião a responsável pela provocação. Assim, empenha-te em primeiro lugar em não ser levado pela ideia e a impressão que tiveste; com efeito, uma vez que ganhes tempo e um prazo [para refletires], será com maior facilidade que te tornarás o senhor de ti mesmo.

Se desejas a filosofia, prepara-te de antemão para seres encarado pela multidão como objeto de ridicularização, como objeto de gracejos50, a dizer “Ele repentinamente se tornou para nós filósofo” e “De onde nos veio essa sua postura orgulhosa?”. No entanto, não assumas uma postura orgulhosa, mas prende-te ao que te parece o melhor, como se fosse um deus que te destinou a essa posição. Lembra que, se te conservares firme em tua posição, aqueles que antes te ridicularizaram passarão depois a te admirarem; se, porém, te deixares vencer pelo abatimento, serás duplamente alvo do riso.

Não te angusties com raciocínios como “Viverei destituído de honras e nada serei em lugar algum”. Com efeito, se a falta de honras é um mal, não podes estar no mal por conta de outra pessoa, tanto quanto não o podes estar na vergonha.

Alguém recebeu maior honra do que tu num banquete, ou dirigiram a palavra a alguém preterindo a ti, ou convocaram alguém para dar conselho em lugar de ti? Na hipótese de essas coisas serem boas, deves te alegrar pelo fato de outra pessoa as haver obtido; se são más, não sofras por não as ter obtido.

Alguém não te convidou para um banquete? É compreensível já que não deste ao anfitrião o que ele cobra pelo jantar62. Ele o vende para ser pago em louvor; ele o vende para ser pago em atenções dirigidas a ele. Portanto, paga-lhe segundo o seu preço de venda, se o que ele vende é para o teu proveito.
