‘Our species doesn’t operate by reality. It operates by stories. Cities are a story. Money is a story. Space was a story, once. A king tells us a story about who we are and why we’re great, and that story is enough to make us go kill people who tell a different story. Or maybe the people kill the king because they don’t like his story and have begun to tell themselves a different one.

Most top predators of the planet are majestic creatures. Millions of years of dominion have filled them with self-confidence. Sapiens by contrast is more like a banana republic dictator. Having so recently been one of the underdogs of the savannah, we are full of fears and anxieties over our position, which makes us doubly cruel and dangerous. Many historical calamities, from deadly wars to ecological catastrophes, have resulted from this over-hasty jump.

Over the past 10,000 years, Homo sapiens has grown so accustomed to being the only human species that it’s hard for us to conceive of any other possibility. Our lack of brothers and sisters makes it easier to imagine that we are the epitome of creation, and that a chasm separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom.

But fiction has enabled us not merely to imagine things, but to do so collectively. We can weave common myths such as the biblical creation story, the Dreamtime myths of Aboriginal Australians, and the nationalist myths of modern states. Such myths give Sapiens the unprecedented ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers.

In other words, while anthropological observations of modern foragers can help us understand some of the possibilities available to ancient foragers, the ancient horizon of possibilities was much broader, and most of it is hidden from our view.* The heated debates about Homo sapiens’ ‘natural way of life’ miss the main point. Ever since the Cognitive Revolution, there hasn’t been a single natural way of life for Sapiens. There are only cultural choices, from among a bewildering palette of possibilities.

There was just one exception to this general rule: the dog. The dog was the first animal domesticated by Homo sapiens, and this occurred before the Agricultural Revolution. Experts disagree about the exact date, but we have incontrovertible evidence of domesticated dogs from about 15,000 years ago. They may have joined the human pack thousands of years earlier. Dogs were used for hunting and fighting, and as an alarm system against wild beasts and human intruders. With the passing of generations, the two species co-evolved to communicate well with each other. Dogs that were most attentive to the needs and feelings of their human companions got extra care and food, and were more likely to survive. Simultaneously, dogs learned to manipulate people for their own needs. A 15,000-year bond has yielded a much deeper understanding and affection between humans and dogs than between humans and any other animal.4 In some cases dead dogs were even buried ceremoniously, much like humans.

Sociopolitical relations, too, tended to be sporadic. The tribe did not serve as a permanent political framework, and even if it had seasonal meeting places, there were no permanent towns or institutions. The average person lived many months without seeing or hearing a human from outside of her own band, and she encountered throughout her life no more than a few hundred humans.

Today, most people in industrial societies don’t need to know much about the natural world in order to survive. What do you really need to know in order to get by as a computer engineer, an insurance agent, a history teacher or a factory worker? You need to know a lot about your own tiny field of expertise, but for the vast majority of life’s necessities you rely blindly on the help of other experts, whose own knowledge is also limited to a tiny field of expertise. The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skilful people in history.

Why do anything else when your lifestyle feeds you amply and supports a rich world of social structures, religious beliefs and political dynamics? All this changed about 10,000 years ago, when Sapiens began to devote almost all their time and effort to manipulating the lives of a few animal and plant species. From sunrise to sunset humans sowed seeds, watered plants, plucked weeds from the ground and led sheep to prime pastures. This work, they thought, would provide them with more fruit, grain and meat. It was a revolution in the way humans lived – the Agricultural Revolution.

Studies of ancient skeletons indicate that the transition to agriculture brought about a plethora of ailments, such as slipped discs, arthritis and hernias. Moreover, the new agricultural tasks demanded so much time that people were forced to settle permanently next to their wheat fields. This completely changed their way of life. We did not domesticate wheat. It domesticated us.

Then why didn’t humans abandon farming when the plan backfired? Partly because it took generations for the small changes to accumulate and transform society and, by then, nobody remembered that they had ever lived differently. And partly because population growth burned humanity’s boats. If the adoption of ploughing increased a village’s population from a hundred to 110, which ten people would have volunteered to starve so that the others could go back to the good old times? There was no going back. The trap snapped shut.

The stress of farming had far-reaching consequences. It was the foundation of large-scale political and social systems. Sadly, the diligent peasants almost never achieved the future economic security they so craved through their hard work in the present. Everywhere, rulers and elites sprang up, living off the peasants’ surplus food and leaving them with only a bare subsistence.

These forfeited food surpluses fuelled politics, wars, art and philosophy. They built palaces, forts, monuments and temples. Until the late modern era, more than 90 percent of humans were peasants who rose each morning to till the land by the sweat of their brows. The extra they produced fed the tiny minority of elites – kings, government officials, soldiers, priests, artists and thinkers – who fill the history books. History is something that very few people have been doing while everyone else was ploughing fields and carrying water buckets.

Rape, in many legal systems, falls under property violation – in other words, the victim is not the woman who was raped but the male who owns her. This being the case, the legal remedy was the transfer of ownership – the rapist was required to pay a bride price to the woman’s father or brother, upon which she became the rapist’s property.

Since myths, rather than biology, define the roles, rights and duties of men and women, the meaning of ‘manhood’ and ‘womanhood’ have varied immensely from one society to another.

Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off. Guaranteeing that every individual will be free to do as he wishes inevitably short-changes equality.

Anyone who has read a novel by Charles Dickens knows that the liberal regimes of nineteenth-century Europe gave priority to individual freedom even if it meant throwing insolvent poor families in prison and giving orphans little choice but to join schools for pickpockets. Anyone who has read a novel by Alexander Solzhenitsyn knows how Communisms egalitarian ideal produced brutal tyrannies that tried to control every aspect of daily life.

Why should the government force me to buy health insurance if I prefer using the money to put my kids through college? Republicans, on the other hand, want to maximise individual freedom, even if it means that the income gap between rich and poor will grow wider and that many Americans will not be able to afford health care.

Julius Caesar and Dante Alighieri never twirled tomato-drenched spaghetti on their forks (even forks hadn’t been invented yet), William Tell never tasted chocolate, and Buddha never spiced up his food with chilli. Potatoes reached Poland and Ireland no more than 400 years ago. The only steak you could obtain in Argentina in 1492 was from a llama.

We begin with the story of the greatest conqueror in history, a conqueror possessed of extreme tolerance and adaptability, thereby turning people into ardent disciples. This conqueror is money. People who do not believe in the same god or obey the same king are more than willing to use the same money. Osama Bin Laden, for all his hatred of American culture, American religion and American politics, was very fond of American dollars. How did money succeed where gods and kings failed?

She reaches and gently scoops up the pup and brings him closer. His body shivers, both cold and scared. She draws him into her warmth. He responds and quiets, his cries softer now, just murmurs against her breast. Through his so-thin ribs, she feels a heartbeat thrumming, so much faster than hers. She drapes a palm along his back, rubbing a thumb by a soft ear. His eyes close, his breathing slows. A warm, soft tongue licks; a small mouth suckles a finger. In that moment, she both senses and learns so much more. Each heartbeat marks the passage of time. The tender body teaches her ///fragility, need, gentleness.

Other physicists have shown that the property of quantum entanglement could be used to move messages into the past (or future)—and it gets even weirder with quantum teleportation (yes, that’s real, too).

It has to do with making shitloads of money off ads trying to sell people crap they don’t need. But the terrible by-product of that is giving a global platform to the absolute worst elements of society. The result is that ‘truth’ is whatever you can convince people it is.

If you learn anything from this guide to listening, let it be a respect for the demands of the music—a realization that understanding jazz (or any other form of artistic expression) can never be reduced to personal whim or some flamboyant deconstructive manipulation of signifiers but always builds on a humble realization that these works impose their reality on us. The work of art always requires us to adapt to it—and in this manner can be distinguished from escapism or shallow entertainment, which instead aims to adapt to the audience, to give the public exactly what it wants. We can tell that we are encountering a real work of art by the degree to which it resists our subjectivity.

But after you have developed your listening skills in jazz, you probably won’t need to make such inquiries. You will feel it in the music and cherish it as the most magical part of the jazz idiom.

If you don’t, you can always leave the jazz club and check out a rock or pop covers band. That’s perfect entertainment for people who want to live in the realm of perfect replication. Jazz, in contrast, is for those who want to be in attendance when the miracle happens.

Colocada a questão nestes termos, meu amigo ficou convencido e investiu seus 25 mil dólares. Resultado: neste setembro de 1985, o netinho festeja 4 anos de idade ganhando mais do que seu pai ganha no trabalho. Seu patrimônio é cinco vezes maior do que se o dinheiro tivesse sido aplicado em caderneta de poupança.

Barbaridade. Bolsa não é nada disso. Os Investidores deveriam comprar ações com a mentalidade das mulheres que compram laranjas nas feiras. Elas só se preocupam em distinguir as laranjas doces das azedas e pagar o preço mais barato possível.

Se, em vez de entrar para um plano de previdência complementar, você investir a mesma quantia em ações, terá um rendimento crescente, que não acabará nunca. Mas se seguir o conselho do jornalista que escreveu aquela matéria, e aplicar em poupança, terá rendimentos mensais de 1.175 dólares após quinze anos, se durante esse tempo aplicar todo mês 200 dólares. Se quiser transformar sua aplicação num saldo perpétuo, você só poderá sacar miseráveis 292 dólares por mês, quantia que em qualquer parte do mundo o colocará abaixo do nível de subsistência. Basta comparar esses míseros 292 dólares com os opulentos 5 mil dólares mensais que você receberia em dividendos, para concluir o quanto são irresponsáveis os conselheiros que não entendem do assunto sobre o qual dão conselhos.

Os índices de correção das pensões são fixados pelo governo, que, desonestamente, manda pagar menos que a taxa de corrosão da moeda. Essa política cruel, mas sistemática, faz com que as pensões decresçam de maneira gradual, quase imperceptível, o que só é constatado depois de alguns anos, quando a vítima não tem mais possibilidade de reagir.

Certa vez, publiquei num jornal um artigo em que incidentalmente eu aconselhava as pessoas a jamais entregar suas ações para administração de terceiros. Eu soube depois que diversos administradores de carteiras de ações se queixaram à direção do jornal, dizendo-se moralmente atingidos sem provas. Certamente vestiam alguma carapuça.

Por volta de 1970, um administrador do Fundo “157” dizia em alto e bom som para quem quisesse ouvir: – Todo dia eu mando comprar. Se a cotação sobe, eu me apodero dos papéis; se desce, jogo-os no “157”. Mensalmente eu faço uma verificação do portfólio. As ações que se valorizaram são minhas; as que se desvalorizaram ficam no Fundo. Só não detalhava sua maneira de agir.

Um exemplo de má divulgação do mercado acionário ocorreu durante a contagem dos votos do primeiro turno das eleições para presidente da República. Os jornais disseram que a Bolsa subiu às 10 horas porque Collor se firmou na liderança; que caiu às 11 porque Lula passou Brizola; e que terminou em queda porque se estreitou a diferença entre Collor e o segundo colocado... Despautérios desse gênero transmitem ao leigo a impressão fantasista de que os Investidores da Bolsa constituem-se de pessoas de raciocínio rápido, com o dedo no gatilho, prontas para tomar decisões instantâneas; de que só ganha na Bolsa quem anda com o ouvido colado ao rádio; e de que o menor erro ou descuido será fatal. De acordo com essa visão, negociar com ações seria tão perigoso quanto andar numa corda bamba, sobre o Anhangabaú, entre os edifícios do Banespa e da antiga Light. Nada mais falso. O Investidor consciente dispensa palpites de operadores que raciocinam rápido. E demora semanas para tomar uma decisão, como o atirador que “dorme” na pontaria. Quando atira, não erra.

I sat there wondering what it would be like dealing with that kind of thing, full-time. Growing up with a head full of beauty and the gift of interpretation, being told how brilliant you were by the people who loved you – getting hooked on the oohs and ahs – only to enter what passed for ‘the real world’ and learn that love didn’t mean a damn thing.

Celebrity by association. For most people, fandom’s a fling that ends when they grow up. But certain borderline personalities never mature, and what starts out as a harmless ego-substitution – the kid standing in front of a mirror playing air guitar and imagining himself to be Hendrix – can turn into a psychological hijacking.’

“One of Heron’s inventions was the means to magically open the doors to a temple using a crude version of a steam engine. A priest would speak to a crowd on the steps of a closed temple, then a fire would be lit in a hearth in front of the place. Once it got blazing hot, the fire would heat a water system buried underneath the hearth. The resulting steam would move pistons, wheels, and ropes, and the temple doors would seem to magically open on their own.”

Antikythera mechanism at the National Archaeological Museum in Athens, a Greek device dated to the first century B.C. It was discovered aboard a shipwreck in 1901, but it would take until we were developing our own computers that the mechanism’s purpose and design became known. Most archaeologists now accept that it is the first known analog computer.

This novel touches upon similar concoctions found in the myths and stories surrounding the sorceress Medea, who helped Jason of the Argonauts defeat all manner of fiery mechanical automatons, from Talos of Crete to the Colchis Bulls. It is said she did develop two important potions: Medea’s Oil (which possessed the secret to an unquenchable fire, a gift from Prometheus, and very much like Greek Fire) and Promethean (what I called “Promethean Blood” in the novel, which

The Greek historian Strabo also believed that Homer’s Tartarus and the rich Spanish city of Tartessos were the same place. And later others believed the biblical city of Tarshish was just a new spelling of that same mysterious metropolis.

What I found again to be a bit of serendipity was how many of Strabo’s theories regarding the true locations of the mythic islands and ports of Homer’s Odyssey ended up falling along the line between the African tectonic plate and its Eurasian neighbor to the north. Does this mean anything? If you read this novel, you know it does.

The story of the “Pope’s Children” is also historically accurate. As to the Holy Scrinium, the original traveling library of the popes, it truly did exist and was said to hold rare treasures going back to the founding of Christendom. Does it still exist? Is it located in ancient Roman vaults beneath Castel Gandolfo? Unfortunately, that was not part of my tour.

Quando te dispões a realizar alguma ação, recorda-te de qual é a natureza dessa ação. Se estás saindo para tomar um banho, antecipa mentalmente o que acontece numa sala de banhos,20 ou seja, indivíduos que jogam água em ti, indivíduos que esbarram em ti, indivíduos que te insultam, indivíduos que te roubam. E assim tu irás executar tua ação com maior segurança se disseres de imediato: “Quero tomar banho e também conservar minha vontade em harmonia com a natureza”.

Não são as coisas que perturbam as pessoas, mas os pareceres a respeito das coisas;21 por exemplo, a morte nada tem de amedrontadora (pois assim também não pareceu a Sócrates),22 mas o parecer sobre a morte é que é amedrontador. A conclusão é que quando experimentamos aborrecimento ou perturbação ou aflição, não é o caso de responsabilizar os outros por isso, mas a nós mesmos, ou seja, aos nossos próprios pareceres. É ação de um ignorante acusar os outros dos próprios males; atribuir a culpa a si mesmo é atitude de alguém que dá início a sua educação; aquele que nem acusa aos outros nem a si mesmo já é alguém educado.

Se queres progredir, resigna-te a parecer externamente um insensato e um estúpido, e nem queiras ostentar que possuis qualquer conhecimento; e se gozares de alguma boa reputação, desconfia de ti mesmo.

Se queres que teus filhos, tua esposa e teus amigos vivam para sempre, és um tolo, pois estás querendo que aquilo que não está subordinado a ti esteja subordinado a ti e que aquilo que não pertence a ti pertença a ti; assim, se queres que teu pequeno escravo não cometa erros, és um insensato, pois neste caso estás querendo que o vício não seja vício, mas uma outra coisa. Se, todavia, o que queres é não deixar de alcançar o que desejas, disso és capaz. Portanto, ocupa-te daquilo de que és capaz. Cada senhor de alguém é aquele que possui o poder sobre o que esse alguém quer ou não quer no sentido de conservá-lo ou suprimi-lo. Consequentemente, aquele que quer ser livre nem deseje nem se esquive das coisas que estão subordinadas a outros, caso contrário será forçosamente um escravo.
